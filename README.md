Caesar Cipher - Python with Tkinter GUI
This project implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm using Python and Tkinter. It provides a simple and user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) for users to easily encrypt and decrypt messages by specifying a shift value. This project showcases basic cryptography and GUI development skills in Python.

Features:
Encrypt and Decrypt: Users can enter a message and a shift value to either encrypt or decrypt the message.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Built using Tkinter, providing a visually appealing and interactive experience.
Handles Special Characters: The program works with uppercase, lowercase letters, spaces, and special characters without altering them.
Error Handling: Proper error handling ensures that invalid input (e.g., non-numeric shift values) is addressed with user-friendly messages.

How to Use:
Run the Script: Download the script and run it using Python.
Enter a Message: Type the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
Enter a Shift Value: Specify the number of positions to shift the letters in the alphabet (e.g., 3 for a Caesar Cipher shift).
Choose Encrypt or Decrypt: Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the message or the "Decrypt" button to decrypt it.

Installation:
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
Install Tkinter (if not already installed):
pip install tk
Run the script in your terminal or Python IDE.


Tech Stack:
Python: Programming language used.
Tkinter: Python library for creating GUIs.
